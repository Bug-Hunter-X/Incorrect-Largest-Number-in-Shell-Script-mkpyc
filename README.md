This repository contains a shell script that aims to find the largest number within a file.  However, the script contains a bug that causes it to fail when the input file contains negative numbers. The bug is demonstrated in `bug.sh`, and a corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.sh`.  The issue arises from initializing `largest_number` to 0; negative numbers are incorrectly considered smaller than 0. The solution initializes `largest_number` to the first number in the file, thus correctly handling negative numbers.
